/*The code for calculating the sum of values from 0 to n^n has an error 
in the recursive call in the else block, which should be corrected with comments. */

//Explanation
/*The function recursively computes the sum of all integers from 0 to n. In the base case, it returns 0 when n is 0, 
and in the recursive case, it returns n plus the result of calling itself with n^−1^n−1. */
